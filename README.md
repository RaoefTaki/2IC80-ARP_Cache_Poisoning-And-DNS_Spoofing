# ARP Cache Poisoning And DNS Spoofing
This tool is an implementation of the ARP Cache Poisoning and DNS Spoofing attack. Here, the DNS Spoofing attack runs on top of the ARP Cache Poisoning. The user can choose between only ARP Cache Poisoning, or both ARP Cache Poisoning and DNS Spoofing. The tool provides a CLI (Command Line Interface) for the user to specify the paramters of the attack.

This tool was made by team Schoolbook_RSA for the course 2IC80 Lab on Offensive Computer Security, given at the TU/e.
